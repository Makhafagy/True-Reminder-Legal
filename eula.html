      <h1>True Reminder — Terms of Service / EULA</h1>
      <p class="meta">Effective date: <strong>January 10, 2026 (Pacific Time)</strong> • Last updated: <strong>January 10, 2026 (Pacific Time)</strong></p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Not legal advice.</strong> This agreement is provided as a template. Consider having counsel
        review before shipping.
      </div>

      <p>
        This Terms of Service / End-User License Agreement (“Agreement”) is a binding agreement between you
        (“you” or “User”)
        and <strong>Mahmoud Khafagy</strong> (an individual) (“Developer,” “we,” “us,” “our”) governing your use
        of the True Reminder iOS application (the “App”).
        If you do not agree, do not use the App.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Critical notice:</strong> The App provides reminders and productivity tools.
        <strong>Notifications may be delayed, missed, or fail entirely</strong>
        due to device settings, Focus modes, OS behavior, battery optimizations, network conditions, time
        changes, or service interruptions.
        <strong>Do not use the App for emergencies or safety-critical tasks.</strong>
      </div>

      <h2>1) Apple required terms (iOS)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Acknowledgement.</strong> This Agreement is between you and the Developer only, not Apple
          Inc. (“Apple”). Apple is not responsible for the App or its content.</li>
        <li><strong>Scope of license.</strong> You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable
          license to use the App on Apple-branded products you own or control, as permitted by Apple’s App
          Store rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance and support.</strong> The Developer is solely responsible for providing any
          maintenance/support. Apple has no support obligations for the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Warranty.</strong> Apple has no warranty obligations except as required by applicable law.
          If the App fails to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple for a refund (if
          applicable under Apple’s policies). Apple has no other warranty responsibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Product claims.</strong> The Developer, not Apple, is responsible for handling claims
          relating to the App (e.g., liability, regulatory, consumer protection, IP infringement).</li>
        <li><strong>Third-party beneficiary.</strong> Apple (and Apple’s subsidiaries) are third-party
          beneficiaries and may enforce this Agreement against you.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2) Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least the minimum age permitted to download and use the App in your region (as determined
        by Apple’s App Store rating and local law).
        The App is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from
        children under 13.
      </p>

      <h2>3) License grant and restrictions</h2>
      <p>Subject to this Agreement, we grant you a revocable, limited license to install and use the App for
        personal, non-commercial use.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code except where permitted by
          law.</li>
        <li>You may not misuse the App to transmit malware, spam, or unlawful content.</li>
        <li>You may not interfere with or attempt to circumvent security, rate limits, or access controls.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4) Your content and shared Spaces</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Your content.</strong> You retain rights to content you create (reminders, notes, Space
          names). You grant us a limited license to process that content solely to operate the App (including
          syncing via iCloud/CloudKit).</li>
        <li><strong>Shared Spaces.</strong> If you invite others to a Space, you understand they may view/edit
          content depending on permissions. You are responsible for who you invite and what you share.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5) Copilot (optional)</h2>
      <p>
        The App may offer an optional Copilot feature that generates suggestions based on your input.
        Copilot requests may be sent to our backend and to <strong>OpenAI (GPT-5 mini)</strong> for processing.
        Copilot output may be incorrect or incomplete. You are responsible for reviewing and confirming changes
        before saving.
      </p>
      <p class="muted"><strong>Do not</strong> submit highly sensitive personal information through Copilot
        prompts.</p>

      <h2>6) Subscriptions, free trial, and billing (Apple IAP)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pro subscription.</strong> Some features may require a paid subscription (“Pro”).</li>
        <li><strong>7-day free trial.</strong> If offered, the free trial lasts <strong>7 days</strong> unless
          otherwise stated in the App Store purchase flow. After the trial, the subscription renews
          automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period, per Apple’s
          rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Billing.</strong> Payment is charged to your Apple ID account upon confirmation. Renewals
          are charged within 24 hours prior to period end.</li>
        <li><strong>Manage/cancel.</strong> You can manage or cancel subscriptions in iOS Settings → Apple ID →
          Subscriptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Refunds.</strong> Refunds are handled by Apple under Apple’s policies, not by the Developer.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">Placeholder: [INSERT CURRENT PRICING / TIERS if you want to state them here, or omit and
        rely on App Store display.]</p>

      <h2>7) No guarantee of notifications; assumption of risk</h2>
      <p>
        You understand and agree that reminders/notifications may fail. You are solely responsible for
        maintaining backups or alternative methods for time-critical tasks.
        The App is not a guaranteed delivery service and is not suitable for emergency or mission-critical use.
      </p>

      <h2>8) Disclaimers of warranties</h2>
      <p>
        THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
        INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
      </p>

      <h2>9) Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE DEVELOPER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
        INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
        OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, GOODWILL, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE
        OF (OR INABILITY TO USE) THE APP,
        INCLUDING MISSED OR DELAYED NOTIFICATIONS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      </p>
      <p>
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DEVELOPER’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS IN ANY 12-MONTH
        PERIOD WILL NOT EXCEED
        THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO THE DEVELOPER (THROUGH APPLE) FOR THE APP OR SUBSCRIPTIONS DURING THAT PERIOD, OR
        US $10, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.
      </p>

      <h2>10) Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Developer from and against claims, damages, losses, and
        expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees)
        arising out of your content, your misuse of the App, your violation of this Agreement, or your violation
        of applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>11) Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate access to optional services (e.g., Copilot or backend features) for abuse,
        security reasons, or legal compliance.
        You may stop using the App at any time. Sections intended to survive (e.g., disclaimers, limitation of
        liability) will survive termination.
      </p>

      <h2>12) Changes to the App or Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        We may update the App and this Agreement over time. Continued use after changes become effective
        constitutes acceptance of the updated Agreement.
      </p>

      <h2>13) Dispute resolution (choose ONE option)</h2>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Option A — Arbitration + class action waiver (template).</strong><br>
        [KEEP THIS OPTION IF YOU WANT ARBITRATION]
        <ul>

          </li>
