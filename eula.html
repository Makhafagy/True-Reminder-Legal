      <h1>True Reminder — Custom End-User License Agreement (EULA)</h1>
      <p class="muted">Effective date: September 28, 2025</p>
      <p>This End-User License Agreement (“Agreement”) is a binding agreement between you (“End-User” or “you”) and Mahmoud Khafagy (“Developer” or “we”).</p>

      <h2>1. Acknowledgment</h2>
      <p>This Agreement is between the End-User and the Developer only, and not Apple, Inc. (“Apple”). The Developer, and not Apple, is solely responsible for the Licensed Application and the content thereof. Although Apple is not a party to this Agreement, Apple is a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement and will have the right to enforce it against you.</p>

      <h2>2. Scope of License</h2>
      <p>The Developer grants you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to install and use the application (“True Reminder” or “App”) solely for your personal, non-commercial purposes on an Apple-branded product that you own or control, and as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the App Store Terms of Service.</p>

      <h2>3. User-Generated Content and Collaborative Spaces</h2>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Content Ownership:</strong> You retain all ownership rights in the content you create or share within the App, including reminder text, schedules, and names of shared “Spaces.”</li>
          <li><strong>Content Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for all content, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness, that you create or share in the App. You agree not to create or share any content that is unlawful, harmful, or abusive.</li>
          <li><strong>Content Removal:</strong> The Developer reserves the right to remove any content that violates this Agreement or is reported as inappropriate, illegal, or abusive.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data Storage and Synchronization</h2>
      <p>You acknowledge that all personal and user-generated data, including reminders and shared “Spaces,” is stored directly in <strong>your private iCloud container</strong> using Apple’s CloudKit service, as detailed in our Privacy Policy. The Developer <strong>does not</strong> access, control, or store your personal data on its own servers. The Developer is <strong>not liable</strong> for any data loss, corruption, or service interruption caused by the iCloud service or related Apple infrastructure.</p>

      <h2>5. Maintenance and Support</h2>
      <p>The Developer is solely responsible for providing any maintenance and support services with respect to the App as specified in this Agreement or as required under applicable law. <strong>You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services</strong> with respect to the App.</p>

      <h2>6. Warranty</h2>
      <p>The App is provided “as is.” To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Developer disclaims all warranties, whether express or implied. In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the App to you (if applicable); and that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App.</p>

      <h2>7. Product Claims</h2>
      <p>The Developer, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection, privacy, or similar legislation.</p>

      <h2>8. Disclaimer of Liability</h2>
      <p>The Developer is <strong>not liable</strong> for any failure of the App to execute, send, or properly time any reminder or notification. You acknowledge that True Reminder is a utility and is not intended to replace critical personal or professional scheduling tools. Any reliance on the App is at your own risk.</p>

      <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to conflicts of law principles.</p>
      
      <h2>10. Changes to this Agreement</h2>
      <p>The Developer reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement at any time. We will post the updated EULA on this page and revise the "Effective date" at the top of the Agreement. Your continued use of the App after the effective date of the new Agreement constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.</p>

      <h2>11. Contact Information</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions, complaints, or claims with respect to the App, please contact: <a href="mailto:truereminderapp@gmail.com">truereminderapp@gmail.com</a></p>
