      <h1>True Reminder — End‑User License Agreement (EULA)</h1>
      <p class="meta">Effective date: September 28, 2025</p>

      <p>
        This End‑User License Agreement (“Agreement”) is a binding agreement between you (“End‑User”, “you”)
        and <strong>Mahmoud Khafagy</strong> (an individual) (“Developer”, “we”, “us”).
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Important:</strong> True Reminder is a productivity utility. Notifications can be delayed or missed due to device settings,
        iOS behavior, Focus modes, battery optimization, or network conditions. Do not rely on the App for emergencies or safety‑critical use.
      </div>

      <h2>1. Acknowledgment</h2>
      <p>
        This Agreement is between you and the Developer only, and not Apple Inc. (“Apple”).
        The Developer, not Apple, is solely responsible for the Licensed Application and its content.
        Apple is a third‑party beneficiary of this Agreement and may enforce it against you.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Scope of License</h2>
      <p>
        The Developer grants you a revocable, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, limited license to install and use the application
        (“True Reminder” or “App”) for personal, non‑commercial purposes on Apple‑branded products that you own or control,
        as permitted by the App Store Usage Rules and Apple’s terms.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Private & Shared Spaces (no public content)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The App is designed for <strong>private reminders</strong> and <strong>private shared Spaces</strong>.</li>
        <li>Shared Space content is visible to the members of that Space. There is no public directory or public feed inside the App.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for who you invite and what you share in a Space.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. User content & acceptable use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You retain ownership of the content you create (reminder titles, schedules, Space names, notes, etc.).</li>
        <li>You agree not to use the App to create, store, or share content that is unlawful, harmful, abusive, harassing, or infringing.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and for any content you share with others.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Data storage & synchronization (iCloud / CloudKit)</h2>
      <p>
        Reminder data and shared Space data are stored in <strong>your iCloud account</strong> using Apple CloudKit, as described in our
        <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. The Developer does not operate a general public database of your reminders/spaces.
        Apple services may be required for syncing and collaboration.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Optional Copilot / AI features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The App may include optional Copilot features that process your request to generate suggested reminder actions.
          These features may send your input (and limited context you choose to include) to the Developer’s backend service and AI providers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Copilot output may be inaccurate, incomplete, or poorly timed. You are responsible for reviewing and confirming any reminders before saving.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not submit highly sensitive personal information through Copilot prompts.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Purchases, subscriptions, and pricing changes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Purchases (including subscriptions) are processed by Apple through the App Store. Refunds, billing, and subscription management are handled by Apple under Apple’s terms.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Developer may change the price of the App, in‑app purchases, or subscription offerings at any time for future purchases.
          If you have an active subscription, Apple controls how price changes are communicated and whether your consent is required.
        </li>
        <li>
          Features and offerings may evolve over time. The Developer may add, remove, or modify features, including introducing paid tiers,
          provided the App continues to function in a commercially reasonable manner.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Maintenance and support</h2>
      <p>
        The Developer is solely responsible for providing maintenance and support for the App, if any.
        Apple has no obligation to furnish maintenance or support services with respect to the App.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Warranty</h2>
      <p>
        The App is provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind to the maximum extent permitted by law.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Disclaimer of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Developer is not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
        or punitive damages, or any loss of data, profits, or goodwill, arising from or related to your use of the App.
        Without limiting the foregoing, the Developer is not liable for missed, delayed, or incorrectly scheduled reminders or notifications.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Developer’s total liability for all claims related to the App
        will not exceed the amount you paid to the Developer (through Apple) for the App or subscriptions in the
        twelve (12) months prior to the event giving rise to the claim.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Developer from claims, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees)
        arising out of your content, your misuse of the App, or your violation of this Agreement or applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Governing law</h2>
      <p>
        This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to conflicts of law principles.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Changes to this Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        The Developer may modify this Agreement from time to time. We will post an updated version and revise the effective date above.
        Continued use of the App after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Agreement.
      </p>
