PRIVACY (short):
True Reminder stores your reminders and shared Spaces in your iCloud/CloudKit.
We may use Apple Push Notifications (including silent/background pushes) to help your devices stay in sync.
If you use Copilot, your request text is sent to our backend and to OpenAI (GPT-5 mini) to generate suggestions.
We don’t sell personal information and we don’t run third-party ads.

KEY TERMS (short):
Notifications can be delayed, missed, or fail for many reasons. Do not rely on True Reminder for emergencies or safety-critical tasks.
Copilot suggestions may be wrong—review before saving.
Subscriptions (including any free trial or introductory offer) are billed by Apple and can be managed in iOS Subscriptions.
By using the app you agree to the Terms and Privacy Policy.
